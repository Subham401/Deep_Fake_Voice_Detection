# Deep_Fake_Voice_Detection
To develop a system that detects whether an audio file is real or AI-generated using machine learning and signal processing.


# 🛡️ AI Guardian – Deepfake Voice Detection

**AI Guardian** is a web-based tool designed to detect whether an audio file contains a real human voice or an AI-generated deepfake. Built with a PyTorch-based model and powered by a Flask API, it allows users to upload audio files and instantly get a prediction — *Real* or *Fake*.
